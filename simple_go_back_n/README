*** This program is written in Java ***

Compiling this program:
Make sure you are in the folder that contains the source code files and Makefile.
Type "make" will compile the sender, the receiver as well as packet class.

Running this program:
Sender and receiver argument formats are in line with specifications in the assignment instruction pdf.

Sample Execution:
host1: ./nEmulator-linux386 9991 host2 9994 9993 host3 9992 1 0.2 0
host2: java receiver host1 9993 9994 output.txt
host3: java sender host1 9991 9992 test.txt

Testing:
This program is tested in MC3007 both on localhost and with one PC(gl26) running the emulator while another(gl09) running the sender and receiver.
It is also tested in undergrad linux environment.

Versions: 
GNU Make 3.81 ; java 1.6.0_24

Note: 
This program assumes EOT ack will never get loss. Loss of EOT ack will result in receiver and sender program not terminating and empty log files.
If an acknowlegdement is delayed for too long in the network that the sender has already gone to next cycle of sequence number, error will occur.
